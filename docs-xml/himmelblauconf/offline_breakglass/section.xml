<title>OFFLINE BREAKGLASS CONFIGURATION</title>
<preamble>
The
.B [offline_breakglass]
section configures Himmelblau's emergency offline authentication mechanism,
used when Azure Entra ID is unavailable.

.P
Offline breakglass allows Entra ID users who normally require multi-factor authentication (MFA)
to authenticate with their cached password when the host is offline.
This feature provides a controlled fallback for MFA-only users who would otherwise be unable
to sign in during an outage.

.P
Single-factor authentication (SFA-only) users and Hello-PIN users
already have offline sign-in capability, and are unaffected by this setting.
This option exists solely to extend limited offline access to
MFA-enabled users when network connectivity to Entra ID cannot be established.
</preamble>
<subsection_intro>
This section controls whether and how Himmelblau may perform offline password authentication
for MFA-enabled users in emergency conditions.
