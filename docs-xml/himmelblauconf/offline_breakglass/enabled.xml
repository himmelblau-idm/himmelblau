<description>
Boolean value specifying whether offline breakglass mode is permitted.

.P
When set to
.B true,
Himmelblau will cache secure, salted password verifiers for
.B MFA-enabled
Entra ID users who successfully authenticate online.
These verifiers can then be used to authenticate the same users when Entra ID is unreachable,
allowing MFA users to log in using their cached password.

.P
If this option is set to
.B false,
Himmelblau will continue to cache password verifiers only for SFA-only users,
and MFA-enabled users will
.B not
be able to authenticate when offline.
The
.BR aad-tool (1)
command
.B aad-tool offline-breakglass
will also have no effect.

.P
Administrators must enable this option well in advance of an outage,
as password verifiers for MFA users are only stored following a successful online authentication.
It is too late to enable this feature once Entra ID is already unreachable.

.P
Enabling offline breakglass mode carries significant risk.
If a device is stolen or compromised, and network access to Entra ID is blocked,
attackers could effectively disable MFA protection by forcing the system into
a simple password-only (SFA) authentication state.
Administrators should enable this mode
.B only after careful consideration
of their organization's security posture and offline access requirements.

.P
This feature does not apply to passwordless accounts.
If an MFA user signs in using a passwordless method,
no password hash exists to cache, and offline breakglass cannot function for that user.
