### Domain specific values
# Individual domain values may be overridden by specifying these values under
# a domain section. These options take precedent over global config options.
# For example:
#
# [example.com]
# odc_provider = odc.officeapps.live.com
# home_prefix = /home/
# home_attr = UUID
# home_alias = SPN
# shell = /bin/zsh
# idmap_range = 6000000-6999999
