# Specify whether to map group IDs (GIDs) based on the object name or object UUID
# when no gidNumber attribute is found in an on-prem Active Directory instance

# required during each login. Disabling Hello authentication is recommeneded
# when the host is public facing (such as via SSH).

# the ACCESS_TOKEN. ACCESS_TOKEN will be empty during offline logon. The return

# This option enables the experimental MFA (multi-factor authentication) flow,

### Domain specific values
# Individual domain values may be overridden by specifying these values under
# a domain section. These options take precedent over global config options.
# For example:
#
# [example.com]
# odc_provider = odc.officeapps.live.com
# home_prefix = /home/
# home_attr = UUID
# home_alias = SPN
# shell = /bin/zsh
# idmap_range = 6000000-6999999
#
# Application ID used for requesting an ACCESS_TOKEN on behalf of the user.
# If not set, the domain’s app_id is used.
# logon_token_app_id = 544e695f-5d78-442e-b14e-e114e95e640c
#
# The `app_id` option specifies the Entra ID application ID that has the
# necessary permissions to obtain access tokens for the `logon_script`. This
# application SHOULD also include the `GroupMember.Read.All` permission,
# enabling Himmelblau to retrieve the `gidNumber` extended attribute.
#
# [example.com]
# app_id = d023f7aa-d214-4b59-911d-6074de623765
